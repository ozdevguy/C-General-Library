  "tagline": "You've heard of the C standard library, but have you heard of the C General Library? This library is a work in progress, and adds extensive functionality and reduced development time to any C project. The library contains implementations of some of the most basic data structures and algorithms, including utf8 character objects, strings, graphs, heaps, stacks, sets, queues, priority queues, trees, and much, much more. This library also allows you to set your own memory allocators and deallocators, as well as your own thread handlers.",
  "body": "# C General Library\r\nThe C General Library is a project that started out as a support library for the Scoots compiler toolkit (for which I am currently working on). The library was also, simply, a fun project, allowing me to turn essential data structures and algorithms into easy to use, universal tools. I hope this library will be able to provide you with a solid skeleton for your C based project.\r\n\r\nI have placed a great emphasis on the efficiency of the tools built into this library, but I'm sure there's even more than can be done. Feel free to download a copy of the library, add features, improve upon code, or anything else you think could make this a great, easy to use toolkit. I'm looking forward to hearing your recommendations! :-)\r\n\r\nThe rest of this page is dedicated to documenting the library and all its features.\r\n\r\n1.

Once you've copied the folder, you can include the main general library header, genlib.h (Individual header files exist for individual library components as well. We'll get to that later)..\r\n\r\n     #include \"lib/genlib.h\" //Include the main general library header.\r\n\r\n     int main(int argc, char* argv[]){\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n     }\r\n\r\nJumping ahead, once you are ready to compile your source code, you must include the pthreads library. For example, using gcc, you would call:\r\n\r\ngcc project.c -pthread -o [executable name]\r\n \r\n<div id=\"library-context\"></div>\r\n##Library Context\r\n\r\nThe C General Library utilizes a context object which contains all the data pertaining to the current instance of the library, such as:\r\n\r\n   + Memory Allocation\r\n   + Memory Deallocation\r\n   + Logging\r\n   + Error Handling\r\n   + Instance Identification\r\n   + External Data\r\n\r\nA defined context is required for using the functions within the library. You can create a new context by generating a new variable of type _**standard_library_context**_, like so:\r\n\r\n     #include \"lib/genlib.h\" //Include the main general library header.\r\n\r\n     int main(int argc, char* argv[]){\r\n       \r\n       //Create a new library context.\r\n       standard_library_context ctx;\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n     }\r\n\r\n<div id=\"default-setup\"></div>\r\n\r\n###Default Setup\r\n\r\nThe standard library provides extensive customization with regards to how memory is handled, logging is accomplished, errors are accounted for, and the encapsulation of external data. In many instances, you may want to apply the default configuration to the library context. By using the default configuration, the library will use calloc() as the memory allocator, free() as the memory deallocator, and all errors and logs will be printed to the console. In order to initialize the context to the default configuration, simply call the _**_std_lib_default()**_ function.\r\n\r\n     #include \"lib/genlib.h\" //Include the main general library header.\r\n\r\n     int main(int argc, char* argv[]){\r\n       \r\n       //Create a new library context.\r\n       standard_library_context ctx;\r\n\r\n       //Initialize the context to the default configuration.\r\n       _std_lib_default(&ctx);\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n     }\r\n\r\n<div id=\"custom-setup\"></div>\r\n###Custom Setup\r\n\r\nWhile using the default context configuration is often good enough for a number of projects, many developers may opt for more control over the behavior of the library. For example, you may be building a software package for an embedded system requiring precise control over memory allocation and error handling. You may even be including the library as part of a large, multi-threaded or multi-process application, and want to create a new context for each thread or process in order to monitor said thread or processes' memory consumption. The C General Library allows you to do all of that. First, let's examine the _**standard_library_context**_ structure...\r\n\r\n     struct standard_library_context{\r\n\r\n         //Library instance ID.\r\n\t uint32_t instance_id;\r\n\r\n\t //Internal data.\r\n\t void* data;\r\n\r\n\t //Pointer to memory allocator.\r\n\t void* (*memory_allocator)(size_t, standard_library_context*);\r\n\r\n\t //Pointer to memory de-allocator.\r\n\t bool (*memory_dealloc)(void*, standard_library_context*);\r\n\r\n\t //Log handler (logger(byte* message, size_t message_length, uint8_t type, standard_library_context* ctx))\r\n\t void* (*logger)(byte*, size_t, uint8_t, standard_library_context*);\r\n\r\n\t //Thread initializer.\r\n\t bool (*create_thread)(void*(void*));\r\n\r\n\t //Operation failure function.\r\n\t void (*operation_failure)(uint8_t, standard_library_context*);\r\n\r\n     }\r\n\r\n**instance_id** = An 32 bit, unsigned integer than can be used to identify a specific portion of a program which uses the context.\r\n\r\n**data** = Need to reference an external object structure when passing a context to a new thread or process? Simply use the **data** variable as a pointer to the external object.\r\n\r\n**memory_allocator** = A pointer to the memory allocator to be used by the library's **allocate()** function.\r\n\r\n**memory_dealloc** =  A pointer to the memory deallocator to be used by the library's **destroy()** function.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cust-alloc-dealloc\"></div>\r\n###Memory Allocators & Deallocators\r\n\r\nIf you need to set up your own memory allocator, you'll need to create a function that accepts three arguments.\r\n\r\n1. First argument of type **size_t**, which is the size of the memory pool to be allocated in bytes.\r\n2. Second argument of type **uint32_t**, which is the instance_id used in the current library context.\r\n3. Third argument of type **void* **, which is a pointer to the external data object that you may have attached to the context.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"framework-functions\"></div>\r\n#Framework Functions\r\n\r\n<div id=\"allocate\"></div>\r\n##Allocating Memory with allocate()\r\n\r\nThe C General Library contains its own built-in memory **allocate()** function, which is used by each component within the library. The **allocate()** function calls the function that has been set for memory allocation. If configuring the library to use defaults by utilizing the **std_lib_default()** function, **allocate()** defaults to **calloc()**, otherwise your own custom allocator is used.\r\n\r\nThe syntax of the **allocate()** function is as follows:\r\n\r\n     void* allocate(standard_library_context* ctx, size_t bytes_to_allocate);\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n     #include \"lib/genlib.h\" //Include the main general library header.\r\n\r\n     int main(int argc, char* argv[]){\r\n       \r\n       //Create a new library context.\r\n       standard_library_context ctx;\r\n\r\n       //Initialize the context to the default configuration.\r\n       _std_lib_default(&ctx);\r\n  \r\n       //Allocate a new variable of type long.\r\n       long* new_long = allocate(&ctx, sizeof(long));\r\n\r\n       //Destroy (free) the allocated variable (we'll explain this in a minute).\r\n       destroy(&ctx, new_long);\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n\r\n     }\r\n\r\n<div id=\"destroy\"></div>\r\n##Freeing Memory with destroy()\r\n\r\nObviously with the **allocate()** function, we need to include a custom library function for releasing memory. That's where **destroy()** comes in. Like **allocate()**, **destroy()** calls the function that has been configured for releasing memory. If you've used the **std_lib_default()** function, the **destroy()** function calls free. Otherwise, your custom memory release function will be called.\r\n\r\nThe syntax of the **destroy()** function is as follows:\r\n\r\n     void destroy(standard_library_context* ctx, void* pointer);\r\n\r\nSee the example above for allocate to see how destroy is used. Essentially, it's just like using free(), except with one additional argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
