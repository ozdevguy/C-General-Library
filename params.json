  "tagline": "You've heard of the C standard library, but have you heard of the C General Library? This library is a work in progress, and adds extensive functionality and reduced development time to any C project. The library contains implementations of some of the most basic data structures and algorithms, including utf8 character objects, strings, graphs, heaps, stacks, sets, queues, priority queues, trees, and much, much more. This library also allows you to set your own memory allocators and deallocators, as well as your own thread handlers.",

Once you've copied the folder, you can include the main general library header, genlib.h (Individual header files exist for individual library components as well. We'll get to that later)..\r\n\r\n     #include \"lib/genlib.h\" //Include the main general library header.\r\n\r\n     int main(int argc, char* argv[]){\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n     }\r\n\r\nJumping ahead, once you are ready to compile your source code, you must include the pthreads library. For example, using gcc, you would call:\r\n\r\ngcc project.c -pthread -o [executable name]\r\n \r\n<div id=\"library-context\"></div>\r\n##Library Context\r\n\r\nThe C General Library utilizes a context object which contains all the data pertaining to the current instance of the library, such as:\r\n\r\n   + Memory Allocation\r\n   + Memory Deallocation\r\n   + Logging\r\n   + Error Handling\r\n   + Instance Identification\r\n   + External Data\r\n\r\nA defined context is required for using the functions within the library. You can create a new context by generating a new variable of type _**standard_library_context**_, like so:\r\n\r\n     #include \"lib/genlib.h\" //Include the main general library header.\r\n\r\n     int main(int argc, char* argv[]){\r\n       \r\n       //Create a new library context.\r\n       standard_library_context ctx;\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n     }\r\n\r\n<div id=\"default-setup\"></div>\r\n\r\n###Default Setup\r\n\r\nThe standard library provides extensive customization with regards to how memory is handled, logging is accomplished, errors are accounted for, and the encapsulation of external data. In many instances, you may want to apply the default configuration to the library context. By using the default configuration, the library will use calloc() as the memory allocator, free() as the memory deallocator, and all errors and logs will be printed to the console. In order to initialize the context to the default configuration, simply call the _**_std_lib_default()**_ function.\r\n\r\n     #include \"lib/genlib.h\" //Include the main general library header.\r\n\r\n     int main(int argc, char* argv[]){\r\n       \r\n       //Create a new library context.\r\n       standard_library_context ctx;\r\n\r\n       //Initialize the context to the default configuration.\r\n       _std_lib_default(&ctx);\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n     }\r\n\r\n<div id=\"custom-setup\"></div>\r\n###Custom Setup\r\n\r\nWhile using the default context configuration often good enough for a number of projects, many developers may opt for more control over the behavior of the library. For example, you may be building a software package for an embedded system requiring precise control over memory allocation and error handling. You may even be including the library as part of a large, multi-threaded or multi-process application, and want to create a new context for each thread or process in order to monitor said thread or processes memory consumption.\r\n",
