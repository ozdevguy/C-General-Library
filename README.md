# C-General-Library
You've heard of the C standard library, but have you heard of the C General Library? This library is a work in progress, and adds extensive functionality and reduced development time to any C project. The library contains implementations of some of the most basic data structures and algorithms, including utf8 character objects, strings, graphs, heaps, stacks, sets, queues, priority queues, trees, and much, much more. This library also allows you to set your own memory allocators and deallocators, as well as your own thread handlers.
